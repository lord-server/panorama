## Installation

*Note: Panorama started as our in-house mapper, and installation is
non-trivial as a result. If you're not comfortable with complicated
setups, check out [mapserver] instead!*

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL backend for your world
- Several gigabytes of disk space for tiles
- A decent CPU and about a gigabyte of RAM, depending on workload
- [`nodes_dump`][nodes_dump] mod installed

### Using Docker (recommended)

This is an easier option, especially if you already use a Docker-based setup for
your server. There are pre-built [Docker images][docker-image] that you can use,
or you can build it yourself using provided Dockerfile.

Here's an example `docker-compose.yml` to get you started:

```yml
version: "3"
services:
  panorama:
    image: ghcr.io/lord-server/panorama:latest
    ports:
      - "33333:33333"
    volumes:
      - "/path/to/minetest/worlds/my-world:/var/lib/panorama/world"
      - "/path/to/minetest/games/minetest_game:/var/lib/panorama/game"
      - "/path/to/config/dir:/etc/panorama"
      - "/path/to/tiles:/var/lib/panorama/tiles"
    command: ["--serve", "--fullrender"]
```

### Building manually

Building panorama manually requires go 1.21 or newer, due to its use
of `log/slog`. Afterwards, build the module with the following
commands:

```
go mod download && go mod verify
go build -v ./cmd/panorama
```

This builds the panorama binary in `./panorama`. 

### Configuration

An example config is provided in `config.example.toml`. To work
correctly, panorama needs to know how to connect to the server and how
to render the world. To connect, you need to specify the postgres
connection using the `world_dsn` variable, panorama is not yet capable
of doing this automatically. If you leave `world_dsn` empty, you might
only receive empty tiles! The node descriptions are obtained from the
world directory using the output from the `nodes_dump` mod.

The textures and meshes (only .obj currently supported) are fetched
from the game and mod directories. These are specified using the
`game_path` and `mod_path`directories.
